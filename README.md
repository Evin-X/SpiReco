# SpiReco
A **Spi**king **Reco**gnition (SpiReco) dataset of high-speed moving objects.


#### __$\bullet$ Introduction__

 
This work provides the first object recognition dataset for spike camera. This dataset is constructed by using a spike camara to capture high-speed moving objects. The main challenges of the dataset are 1) high-speed; 2) noise of real spiking data; 3) various motion patterns; 4) various illumanation conditions. We visualize several samples in SpiReco as bellow:
